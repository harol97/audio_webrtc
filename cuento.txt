Tom and the Mysterious Journey.
ReadTom was a little boy who loved to think about adventures.
One day, he climbed a tree near his house, filling his bag full of snacks. As he reached the top, he saw a ship floating in the sky!
Suddenly, a strong wind blew, and he lost his bit of balance, falling onto a fluffy cloud. “I need to leave this place!” he thought. Then, he noticed a white sheet of paper stuck on the cloud. It was a treasure map!
Tom followed the map and arrived at a beautiful beach where he found a cheap golden coin. He saw a cat sitting near a bad storm approaching. He pulled out his pen and drew a raft to escape.
As he floated across the water, he saw a man talking to a bright sun in the sky. The man told him, “If you want to find the treasure, go past the band playing in the woods.”
Tom ran until he reached a river where he saw a huge hat floating. “This must be a clue!” he said. He picked up the word written inside it: "cup."
Just then, he tripped over a fun little rock. He heard a bat screeching and saw a hop sign pointing to an island. “I need to run there fast!” he thought.
On the island, he met a came and found a pool filled with glowing fish. A bell rang, and a will appeared in the sky, saying: "You must sell your fears to open the treasure!"
Tom took a deep breath, climbed a hill, and found a hell of a challenge: a door made of bull horns! “What now?” he wondered.
He remembered the call he had heard before: "tall trees hide the truth." He looked around and saw a tell sign next to a kill switch. He pressed it, and the door opened!
Inside, he found a steal box filled with golden gems. But as soon as he touched them, he felt a fill of warm air surrounding him.
The cool treasure started glowing, and suddenly, he was back home. "That was an amazing adventure!" he said, feeling lucky.
Just then, his mom called, "Dinner time, Tom!" He smiled, looking at the duck toy on his shelf, knowing that tomorrow would bring another adventure.
The End.
